        <!-- <p class="section-paragraph">The lessee or his/her representative has to be present at the agreed date and time of delivery Otherwise extra shipping costs incurred i.e. INR 1000 will be charged by the lessor.</p> -->

        <ul>
          <li>
            The renter (or their authorized representative) must be available at
            the scheduled date and time of delivery. If nobody is present,
            additional delivery charges (INR 1000) will be applied by the
            provider.
          </li>
          <li>
            Items cannot be returned unless they have significant defects or are
            inoperable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Even though we conduct quality inspections before dispatch, the
            renter must inspect for any damage upon receipt and notify the
            provider’s representative immediately; such damage should also be
            documented.
          </li>
          <li>Each party must keep one signed copy of the agreement.</li>
          <li>
            The renter is responsible for ensuring the delivery vehicle can
            enter the premises and for securing permission to use any elevator.
            If there is no elevator or permission is denied, extra labor charges
            for carrying the items via stairs will apply.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Definition of Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
          “Personal Information” refers to any data that can identify, contact, or locate an individual. This includes sensitive personal data, such as medical history.
        </p>

        <h3>Cancellation & Pickup Policy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the renter wishes to end the agreement early, they must inform the provider at least one day in advance. The provider will also send a notice confirming the termination.
          </li>
          <li>
         The date and time for pickup will be decided mutually. The renter must be present at the agreed-upon time; otherwise, additional logistics fees will be charged.
          </li>
          <li>
            Orders may be canceled by the renter free of charge up until the confirmation call for delivery. If cancellation occurs after the delivery confirmation call, delivery and pickup fees will apply.
          </li>
        </ul>
